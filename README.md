My objective was to forecast Britannia Company's equity shares using data from January 3, 2021, to January 3, 2022 using ARIMA model. 

While ARIMA models are commonly used for time series forecasting, point forecasts showed limited accuracy, as indicated by metrics like MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.

Interestingly, my ARIMA model excelled in revealing uncertainty. Prediction intervals accurately covered actual values 89% of the time, highlighting underlying uncertainty in the dataset.

To improve the model, I suggest exploring outlier detection and treatment strategies for more precise forecasting.

This journey emphasizes that forecasting isn't solely about predicting values; it's also about understanding and leveraging uncertainty.

My ARIMA model enhances decision-making by illuminating uncertainty in the data.
